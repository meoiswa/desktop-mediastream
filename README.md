# Desktop-Mediastream

Tool to simplify streaming a game (with no audio) and music.
Intended to be loaded on a browser window, along with music in another tab (from some streaming website), and stream the browser on Discord.
On load, you'll be asked which screen/window/app you wish to show on the tab.
